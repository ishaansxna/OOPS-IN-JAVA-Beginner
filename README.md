## Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java 🏗️

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around objects rather than functions and logic. Java follows OOP principles, which make code reusable, scalable, and maintainable. The core concepts of OOP in Java are:

1. **Class** 📦: A blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (fields) and behaviors (methods).
2. **Object** 🔹: An instance of a class with specific values assigned to its attributes.
3. **Encapsulation** 🔒: Wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit (class) and restricting direct access to it.
4. **Inheritance** 🏛️: Allows a class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class, promoting code reusability.
5. **Polymorphism** 🔀: The ability of a method or function to take multiple forms (method overloading and method overriding).
6. **Abstraction** 🎭: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary functionalities.
